			<h1>We're Getting Hitched!</h1>

			<p>So we've been together for like, 10 years. That's a long time. We have moved across the country together, and been through a whole lot more. We're kind of perfect for one another. Now it's time to make it official!</p>

			<h2>The Details&hellip;</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span>When?</span> August 2, 2014 @ 4:00pm</li>
				<li><span>Where?</span> Washington Park Arboretum</li>
				<li><span>Food?</span> El Gaucho in Bellevue</li>
				<li><span>Who?</span> Us. Of course. And you too!</li>
				<li><span>Why?</span> Mostly for legal reasons.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>That's right, it's all happening on Saturday, August 2. We plan on arriving at the Arboretum around 3pm. The ceremony will be held at the Lookout Gazebo, located within the Arboretum. The ceremony will start at 4pm. Afterwards, we invite all of our guests to join us at the Red Mountain room located in El Gaucho, Bellevue. Dinner and drinks are on us (And by us, I of course mean Mals' Dad. Thanks Dad!).
